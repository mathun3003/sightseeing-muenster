The app was implemented with [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/). An EfficientNetV2 was fine-tuned using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) on scraped images from Bing Search.

The model was trained on images of various sights from M端nster with a very good performance (>90% accuracy). Then, its weights were exported and loaded to the model in the web app. The app user can take a photo of any sight the model was trained on. With that photo, the model makes a prediction and outputs the name of the sight as well as some tourist information.

The web app is hosted on GitHub Pages.
